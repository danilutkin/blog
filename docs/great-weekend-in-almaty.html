            <h1>Great Weekend in Almaty</h1>

                <p>Almaty never fails to surprise me. This weekend was particularly magical - the kind that makes you fall in love with a city all over again.</p>
<br>
<p>Started Saturday morning with a walk through Panfilov Park. The autumn leaves were at their peak, creating this golden carpet that crunched underfoot. Found a small café tucked away behind the opera house where they serve the most incredible samsa - flaky, buttery, and filled with perfectly spiced lamb.</p>
<br>
<p>The highlight was stumbling upon a local art market near Zhibek Zholy. Met this incredible painter who works exclusively with natural pigments from the mountains. His landscapes of the Tian Shan range were breathtaking - you could almost feel the crisp mountain air.</p>
<br>
<p>Sunday brought an impromptu trip to the Green Bazaar. The colors, the smells, the energy - it&#x27;s like stepping into a different world. Bought some dried fruits and nuts from a vendor who&#x27;s been there for 30 years. His stories about the market&#x27;s history were fascinating.</p>
<br>
<p>Ended the weekend with dinner at a family-run restaurant in the old town. The owner&#x27;s grandmother was in the kitchen, and the recipes have been passed down for generations. The plov was unlike anything I&#x27;ve had before.</p>
<br>
<p>Sometimes the best weekends are the unplanned ones. Almaty has this way of revealing its secrets when you least expect it.</p>
