Researching El Norte de España

There's something about northern Spain that calls to me. Maybe it's the rugged coastline, the ancient Celtic heritage, or the way the mountains meet the sea. I've been researching the region for months now, and each discovery makes me more eager to visit.

The Camino de Santiago has been on my bucket list forever, but I'm particularly drawn to the northern route - the Camino del Norte. It follows the coast from Irún to Santiago, passing through the Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias, and Galicia. The scenery must be incredible.

What fascinates me most is the cultural diversity. The Basque language, Euskera, is completely unrelated to any other European language. The Asturian bagpipes, the Celtic influence in Galicia - it's like stepping into a different world within Spain itself.

I've been reading about the fishing villages along the coast, places like San Sebastián and Santander. The food culture is incredible - fresh seafood, cider from Asturias, the famous pintxos in the Basque Country. Each region has its own culinary traditions.

The architecture is another draw. From the Gothic cathedrals to the traditional caseríos (farmhouses) in the countryside, there's such a rich variety. The Guggenheim in Bilbao is obviously famous, but I'm more interested in the smaller museums and cultural centers.

Planning to spend at least a month there next spring. Want to walk parts of the Camino, explore the coastal towns, and really immerse myself in the local culture. Sometimes the best trips are the ones you research obsessively before going.

El norte de España, te espero.
