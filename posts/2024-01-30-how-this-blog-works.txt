How This Blog Works

This site is deliberately tiny. Every story lives as a text file inside the `posts/` folder, and `python3 build.py` glues them together into one HTML page at `docs/index.html`.

To add something new, drop another text file in `posts/` using the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.txt`. Keep the title on the first line, leave a blank line, and then write the story in plain paragraphs or bullets that start with `- `. Run `python3 build.py` to rebuild the page.

Need to remove a story? Delete its text file and rebuild. The single page is recreated from scratch each time, so it will only show the files that still exist.

No templates, no feeds, and no extra assetsâ€”just text files in, one page out.
