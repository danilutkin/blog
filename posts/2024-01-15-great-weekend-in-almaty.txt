Great Weekend in Almaty

Almaty never fails to surprise me. This weekend was particularly magical - the kind that makes you fall in love with a city all over again.

Started Saturday morning with a walk through Panfilov Park. The autumn leaves were at their peak, creating this golden carpet that crunched underfoot. Found a small caf√© tucked away behind the opera house where they serve the most incredible samsa - flaky, buttery, and filled with perfectly spiced lamb.

The highlight was stumbling upon a local art market near Zhibek Zholy. Met this incredible painter who works exclusively with natural pigments from the mountains. His landscapes of the Tian Shan range were breathtaking - you could almost feel the crisp mountain air.

Sunday brought an impromptu trip to the Green Bazaar. The colors, the smells, the energy - it's like stepping into a different world. Bought some dried fruits and nuts from a vendor who's been there for 30 years. His stories about the market's history were fascinating.

Ended the weekend with dinner at a family-run restaurant in the old town. The owner's grandmother was in the kitchen, and the recipes have been passed down for generations. The plov was unlike anything I've had before.

Sometimes the best weekends are the unplanned ones. Almaty has this way of revealing its secrets when you least expect it.
